# Features
Area Selection for Screenshots: Users can select a specific area of their screen to capture using a simple mouse drag.

1. Image and Text Mode: ClipSnip supports two modes - capturing the selected area as an image or extracting text from the selected area using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

2. Clipboard Integration: Captured images or extracted text are automatically copied to the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications.

3. Customizable Interface: The application features a minimalist design that is both easy to use and non-intrusive, with options to switch between image and text capture modes.

# What Makes ClipSnip Different from the Windows 11 Snipping Tool?
While the Windows 11 Snipping Tool is a handy utility for taking screenshots, ClipSnip offers several features and enhancements that cater to users looking for more functionality and flexibility:

1. Text Extraction: Unlike the Snipping Tool, ClipSnip incorporates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This allows users not only to capture screenshots but also to extract and copy text from the captured images directly to the clipboard, streamlining workflows that involve text capture from various applications and websites.

2. Direct Clipboard Access: With ClipSnip, the moment you capture a screenshot or extract text, it's automatically copied to the clipboard. This eliminates the extra step of manually saving and then copying the content, making your screen capture process faster and more efficient.

3. Customizable User Experience: ClipSnip provides a minimalist and non-intrusive user interface that focuses on functionality, allowing for quick switches between image and text capture modes without navigating through multiple options or settings.

4. Enhanced Image Handling: When capturing screenshots, ClipSnip allows for immediate manipulation, such as adding a red border around the image before it's copied to the clipboard, which can be particularly useful for highlighting or drawing attention to specific areas of the screenshot.

5. Simplicity and Speed: Designed with ease of use in mind, ClipSnip streamlines the screen capture process with a few simple clicks, making it accessible for all users regardless of their technical expertise.

6. ClipSnip is designed to complement and enhance the screen-capturing experience, offering additional functionalities that are not available in the built-in Windows 11 Snipping Tool, making it an essential tool for users who frequently work with screenshots and text extraction.
